# 1) Countdown - Create a function that accepts a number as an input.
# Return a new list that counts down by one, from the number
# (as the 0th element) down to 0 (as the last element).
# Example: countdown(5) should return [5,4,3,2,1,0]


def countDown(y):
    for z in range(y,0,-1):
            print (z)
countDown(5)

# 2) Print and Return - Create a function that will receive a list with two numbers. Print the first value and return the second.
# Example: print_and_return([1,2]) should print 1 and return 2

# def a():
#     a_List = [1, 2]
#     print(a_List[0])
#     return[1]


# a()

# 3) First Plus Length - Create a function that accepts a list and returns the sum of the first value in the list plus the list's length.
# Example: first_plus_length([1,2,3,4,5]) should return 6 (first value: 1 + length: 5)

# def a(a_List):
#     x= len(a_List) + a_List[0]
#     return x
# a_List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# a(a_List)

# 4) Values Greater than Second - Write a function that accepts a list and creates a new list containing only
#    the values from the original list that are greater than its 2nd value. Print how many values this is and 
#    then return the new list. If the list has less than 2 elements, have the function return False
#    Example: values_greater_than_second([5,2,3,2,1,4]) should print 3 and return [5,3,4]
#    Example: values_greater_than_second([3]) should return False

# a_list = [5,2,3,2,1,4]

# list_length = len(a_list)
# for i in range(list_length):
#     if(a_list[1] >2 ):
# 	a_list.append(a_list[i]+1)
#     if(a_list= (a_list < 2))
#       return False
            

# print(a_list)
# need help on this one will ask questions about it in class and resubmit

# 5) This Length, That Value - Write a function that accepts two integers as parameters: size and value. 
# The function should create and return a list whose length is equal to the given size, and whose values are all the given value.
# Example: length_and_value(4,7) should return [7,7,7,7]
# Example: length_and_value(6,2) should return [2,2,2,2,2,2]

# def lengthVal(y,z):
#     for i in range(len(og_List)):
        
#         x = len (og_List)
#         print(og_List)
#         new_List = og_List + (len(og_List))
#         return new_List
        
        

# og_List = [2,3]
# new_List = []
# lengthVal(2,3)

# need help on this one will ask questions about it in class and resubmit
